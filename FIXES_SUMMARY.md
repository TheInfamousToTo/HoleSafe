## 📈 Results

- **Loading Time**: Significantly improved with optimized builds and caching
- **Dark Mode**: Now default with proper Pi-hole theming
- **Docker Names**: All containers and images use "holesafe" branding
- **User Experience**: Professional, fast-loading interface with Pi-hole aesthetic
- **Performance**: Optimized React components and Docker containers

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ Frontend container running on port 3000
- ✅ Backend container running on port 3001
- ✅ Health endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ Dark mode applied by default
- ✅ HoleSafe branding visible throughout
- ✅ Docker containers properly named

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the application in browser to verify all changes
2. Verify dark mode is working properly across all components
3. Test performance improvements
4. Optionally add a custom favicon for better branding

The application is now fully rebranded, optimized for performance, defaults to dark mode, and uses consistent "holesafe" naming across all Docker and GitHub configurations.
